[ how this project works ]
1. Run 'download_dataset.R' to download datafile from outside link.
It will download file 'Dataset.zip' and unzip to produce 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder.
2. Execute 'run_analysis.R' to analyze data in 'UCI HAR Dataset' as given instructions.
It will automatically produce 'data2.txt' as a result.
Because data files are few megabytes(MB), execution of 'run_analysis.R' might take some minutes. Please wait for it.

DONE!!
